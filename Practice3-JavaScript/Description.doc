Description

The SVG Drawing Tool is a simple web-based application that allows users to draw freehand inside an SVG canvas using mouse events. When the user presses the mouse button (mousedown) on the canvas and drags (mousemove), a continuous path is drawn that follows the cursor. When the mouse is released (mouseup) or leaves the canvas (mouseleave), the drawing action stops.

This tool demonstrates the use of:

SVG <path> elements to represent freehand lines.

JavaScript DOM manipulation to dynamically create and update path data (d attribute).

Mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) for interactive drawing.npm create vite@latest my-react-apps
