Title

Student Registration Form with HTML5 Validation

Objective

To design and implement a basic student registration form using HTML that collects user information and ensures valid input through HTML5 form validation features.
The goal is to create a simple, user-friendly, and error-resistant form interface.


In this experiment, a web-based student registration form is developed using pure HTML5.
The form includes the following input fields:

Name: Accepts alphabetic characters only.

Email: Ensures a valid email format using the type="email" attribute.

Age: Accepts only numerical values with appropriate range validation.

Each field is equipped with HTML5 validation attributes such as required, type, pattern, and min/max to verify the correctness of user input before submission.
