1. Overall Idea

You have a list of products, each belonging to a category (Clothing, Electronics, Books).

A dropdown menu allows the user to choose a category.

When the user changes the selection, the product list updates instantly to show only items from that category.

This filtering is done directly in the browser using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM).

2. Structure (HTML role)

The HTML file contains:

A heading for the product list.

A dropdown (select element) with category options.

An empty container (a div) that will later be filled with products.

The dropdown has unique identifiers so JavaScript can access it.

The container is just a placeholder; it starts empty, and products are added dynamically.

3. Appearance (CSS role)

CSS styles the page to make it readable and organized.

The outer box has borders and padding so the filter section looks like a neat panel.

The dropdown is styled for usability.

Each product is styled as a separate box with borders and a background, so they look distinct from one another.

4. Logic (JavaScript role)

Data Source

Products are stored in a JavaScript array as objects with two properties: name and category.

This acts as the product database inside the page.

Accessing the DOM

JavaScript locates the dropdown and the product list container using their IDs.

Display Function

A function is written that:

Clears the product list area.

Checks which category is selected.

Filters the product array to include only products that match the chosen category.

Creates new HTML elements for each filtered product and inserts them into the container.

Event Handling

An event listener is attached to the dropdown.

Whenever the user changes the category, the function is triggered, and the product list is refreshed.

Initial Display

On first page load, all products are displayed before the user applies any filter.

5. Flow of Events

Page loads → HTML structure and CSS styling appear.

JavaScript runs → all products are shown by default.

User selects a category → JavaScript listens to this action.

JavaScript filters the product array and updates the DOM.

The displayed list changes immediately without refreshing the page.

6. Key Concepts Illustrated

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript dynamically adds or removes product elements inside the HTML.

Event Handling: Dropdown selection triggers the update.

Filtering Data: Products are filtered based on category.

Separation of Concerns: HTML for structure, CSS for style, JS for behavior.

7. Advantages of This Approach

Interactive and user-friendly — no page reload needed.

Efficient for small-to-medium product lists.

Demonstrates the basics of building dynamic web pages using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
