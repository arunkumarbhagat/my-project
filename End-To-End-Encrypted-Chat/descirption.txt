🔐 Project Title:

End-to-End Encrypted Secure Chat Application

📘 Project Description:

This project is a real-time chat application built with Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and MongoDB, designed to provide secure, private communication between users using end-to-end encryption (E2EE).

Unlike ordinary chat apps where the server can read messages, this system ensures that only the sender and receiver can decrypt and read the messages — the server merely relays encrypted data. This approach keeps user data safe from unauthorized access, even if the database or server is compromised.

⚙️ Key Features:
1. 🔒 End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

Messages are encrypted on the sender’s browser using AES encryption (via CryptoJS).

The encrypted text (ciphertext) is sent to the server through Socket.IO.

The server never decrypts the messages — it just relays them to other clients in the same chat room.

Each chat room has its own shared password/key used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

2. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-Room Chat System

Users can create or join rooms with a name and password.

The room password is hashed using bcrypt before storing in MongoDB — so even the database doesn’t know the real password.

Users in the same room can exchange encrypted messages securely.

3. 🧰 Backend (Server-Side)

Built using Node.js + Express for server routes and APIs.

Socket.IO provides real-time, event-driven communication between server and clients.

MongoDB (with Mongoose) stores room details and hashed passwords.

bcrypt is used for password hashing and validation.

dotenv manages environment variables (Mongo URI, port, etc.).

4. 💬 Frontend (Client-Side)

Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend served from the public/ folder.

Uses Socket.IO client and CryptoJS (AES encryption) in the browser.

Users can:

Create a new room (with password)

Join existing rooms (password-protected)

Send and receive encrypted messages in real time
