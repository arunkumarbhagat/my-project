CLI Employee Management System
## Project Description

This project is about building a command-line interface (CLI) application using Node.js to manage a list of employees. The application is fully interactive, allowing users to add, view, and remove employees directly from the terminal.

All employee data (such as name and ID) is stored in an in-memory array, meaning the data only persists while the application is running. User interaction is powered by Node.js’s built-in readline module, which captures input from the command line and processes it accordingly.

## Learning Outcomes

Node.js Fundamentals

Hands-on experience running a Node.js application and understanding its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model through the readline module. ⚙️

CLI Application Development

Learn how to build terminal-based tools, a common pattern for developer utilities, automation scripts, and backend services.

User Input Handling

Gain skills in prompting users, capturing input, and executing actions based on their responses.

Core JavaScript & Array Operations

Strengthen knowledge of arrays and methods like push() (add employees), forEach()/map() (display employees), and filter()/splice() (remove employees).

Asynchronous Programming

Work with asynchronous operations and callbacks via the readline interface.

Application Logic & Structure

Practice structuring a program using functions, loops, and conditionals (if/else, switch) to create a user-friendly interactive menu.
