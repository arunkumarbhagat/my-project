Project Description – ProductCard with Props

In this project, I created a simple React app that shows a list of products in a nice card layout. The idea is to make a reusable component called ProductCard that can display different product details like the name, price, and stock status.

Instead of writing separate code for each product, I just pass the details as props. This way, the same component can show information for a Wireless Mouse, a Keyboard, or even a Monitor — without changing the actual component code.

The app is styled with a bit of CSS to make the cards look neat and easy to read. Each card clearly shows the product’s name (bold), its price, and whether it’s in stock or out of stock.

 What I learned

How to use props in React to pass dynamic data.

How to make a reusable component instead of repeating code.

How to use simple CSS styling to create a clean card layout.

How different React files (App.jsx, ProductCard.jsx, main.jsx) fit together to build a small project.

In the end, I got a clean product list where each item looks like a card. It feels much more organized than just listing text, and it shows how powerful props can be for reusing components.
